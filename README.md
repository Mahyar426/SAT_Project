# SAT_Project
Repository organized as follows:

### Coding scripts
Section dedicated to mimic LDPC codes of rate 1/2 for Telecommand (TC) link and Telemetry (TM) link, through Monte Carlo simulations.

### Ranging scripts
Section dedicated to the study and implementation of state-of-the-art ranging techniques to evaluate distance and position.

### Satellite scenario
Realistic scenario of a LEO satellite with ground stations around the Earth, to model a full communication system. This section is the ensemble of the twos, with the validated results from both parts to obtain a proper performance evaluation of the system.
